 * This is the magic of esbuild. During compilation, the expression above will be translated into:

 * ```ts
 * const NoteEditor = require("anki/NoteEditor");

/**
 * You can import types from Anki repo directly, if you prefix them with `@anki'.
 * This can be helpful for typing callbacks (see below).
 *
 * Disclaimers:
 * 1. Do no try to import anything but types in this manner! It will not work.
 * 2. Types have less guarantee to stay unchanged and/or be moved to other files.
 *    This will not break you build however, as esbuild does not depend on Typescript
 *    types for a build to succeed.
